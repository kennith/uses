# Uses
A not so detail apps and gear. Inspired by WesBos. 

## Editor + Terminal
- [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is my editor. It's because of its simplicity, the support from [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/), and the very good looking [fileicon](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/FileIcons%20Mono). 
- Vi for quick editing and `git` stuff. My [.vimrc](https://github.com/kennith/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc) is very useful to me. 
- I use the Terminal.app with Zsh and Oh My Zsh. 

## Desktop Apps
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com) keeps me on track and focus. 
- [iVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) keeps me protected.

## Equipments
- MacBook Pro for work.
- Pixel 3a for mobility.
- iPad for in between work and mobility.
